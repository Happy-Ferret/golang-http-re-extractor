# golang-http-re-extractor

## Description
This project is designed to **test** the functionality of golang (Program language) to extract information from http pages. The regular expression employed extract two information from the target webpage.

## Requirements
This code was designed to work on linux systems, using libnotify library and golang runtime environment. The required libraries should be described in source code.

## RE - Regular Expression
They are not fine tuned. The ideal should be one step extraction. Thinking this code as a microservice from a group of bigger services.

## Future
Database implementation. I think using Redis and a nosql database like mongodb should be nice.
